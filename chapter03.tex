This research extends upon previously developed methods to determine something about some thing. A figure here helps get the message across.

\section{My New Approach}
The pipeline of \citet{Stieh2013} is enhanced through the use of full structure assemblies, energy minimization, advanced compression techniques and a fully automatic execution environment. Notice the citation format, this is an inline citation used to call out a specific article, see the source code of this chapter. I may want to cite it as a matter of fact, in which case I want it to appear like this \citep{Stieh2013}. 

More graphics help get the message across

\subsection{Some Specific Details of Part A}
Structure modeling is facilitated through comparative modeling by Modeller \citep{Sali1993}. 

More Figures as needed
\subsection{Some Specific Details of Part B}
Once theoretical models are generated by Modeller, the structures are energy minimized by Gromacs \citep{Berendsen1995, Lindahl2001}.
