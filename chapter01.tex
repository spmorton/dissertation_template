This is the introduction chapter, use it to introduce the audience to what this Thesis/Dissertation represents. Maybe your work is biology related and deals with proteins. Good graphics help assist with the introduction, see Figures \ref{fig:ala} and \ref{fig:ASN-ALA-CYS}. You might also want to mention your related publications.
%This research The sequence of amino acids that comprise a protein determines the shape and function, or more specifically, how the protein interacts with other proteins. Regardless of reference to the catalytic power of a protein, or the selectivity a certain protein has for interacting with another \citep{Garrett2010,Ma2011,AbdoolKarim2010}, the end result is a protein-protein interaction.

The R group (green shading)  for Alanine is $CH_3$. Carbon is depicted as dark gray, hydrogen is light gray, oxygen is red and nitrogen is blue. Amino acid produced by Avogadro \citep{Hanwell2012}.}
